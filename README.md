# Reproducible Research with R, Git, and GitHub

This workshop was conducted by Robert Schick from Duke University (https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/alumni/schick).  In this workshop we explored how to use git to support all phases of an R-based analysis, including: data cleaning, data storage, exploratory data analysis, documentation, modeling, and presentationâ€”including static, print, and interactive web-based outputs. We will learn what git is, what it is capable of, how take advantage of its branching model, and how to connect to public code repositories like GitHub and BitBucket. Participants will learn how to use MAKE files to support a workflow. Participants will also learn how to prepare a worked example designed to accompany a submitted, or published manuscript.

Some key papers discussed on the importance of reproducible science:

# Things to consider given reproducibility
  Submitting data to a reputable DOI-issusing repo
  Submitting the code (if not too embarassed) to a reputable DOI-issusing repo
  
  Have your analysis BE an R package (http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)
    This may be more work than is necessary and not optimal for a workflow for research, but this could be key if want to break up the          workflow nto discrete chunks.
    
  During the research analytics and formulation, use a project notebook such as RMarkdown/Evernote.  This can also be critical to annotate the actual code for transparency.
